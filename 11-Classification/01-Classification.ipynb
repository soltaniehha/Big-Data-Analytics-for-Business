    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the task of predicting a label, category, class, or discrete variable given some input features. The key difference from other ML tasks, such as regression, is that the output label has a finite set of possible values (e.g., three classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few of the multitude of ways classification can be used in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predicting credit risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "A financing company might look at a number of variables before offering a loan to a company or individual. Whether or not to offer the loan is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**News classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm might be trained to predict the topic of a news article (sports, politics, business, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classifying human activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "By collecting data from sensors such as a phone accelerometer or smart watch, you can predict the person’s activity. The output will be one of a finite set of classes (e.g., walking, sleeping, standing, or running).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, let’s review several different types of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of classification is binary classification, where there are only two labels you can predict. One example is fraud analytics, where a given transaction can be classified as fraudulent or not; or email spam, where a given email can be classified as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond binary classification lies multiclass classification, where one label is chosen from more than two distinct possible labels. A typical example is Facebook predicting the people in a given photo or a meterologist predicting the weather (rainy, sunny, cloudy, etc.). Note how there is always a finite set of classes to predict; it’s never unbounded. This is also called multinomial classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilabel Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is multilabel classification, where a given input can produce multiple labels. For example, you might want to predict a book’s genre based on the text of the book itself. While this could be multiclass, it’s probably better suited for multilabel because a book may fall into multiple genres. Another example of multilabel classification is identifying the number of objects that appear in an image. Note that in this example, the number of output predictions is not necessarily fixed, and could vary from image to image."

It is a linear method that combines each of the individual inputs (or features) with specific weights (these weights are generated during the training process) that are then combined to get a probability of belonging to a particular class.

For this reason, it can be used as a simple feature-selection method. On the other hand, L2 regularization (a value of 0) does not create sparsity because the corresponding weights for particular features will only be driven toward zero, but will never completely reach zero.

    "Once the model is trained you can get information about the model by taking a look at the coefficients and the intercept. The coefficients correspond to the individual feature weights (each feature weight is multiplied by each respective feature to compute the prediction) while the intercept is the value of the italics-intercept (if we chose to fit one when specifying the model). Seeing the coefficients can be helpful for inspecting the model that you built and comparing how features affect the prediction:"

It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, Higher the AUC, better the model is at distinguishing between patients with disease and no disease. AUC typically varies between 0.5 and 1. A 0.5 AUC is indicating that the model is as good as a random guess, 1 is a perfect model."

    "## Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are one of the more friendly and interpretable models for performing classification because they’re similar to simple decision models that humans use quite often. For example, if you have to predict whether or not someone will eat ice cream when offered, a good feature might be whether or not that individual likes ice cream. In pseudocode, if person.likes(“ice_cream”), they will eat ice cream; otherwise, they won’t eat ice cream. A decision tree creates this type of structure with all the inputs and follows a set of branches when it comes time to make a prediction. This makes it a great starting point model because it’s easy to reason about, easy to inspect, and makes very few assumptions about the structure of the data. In short, rather than trying to train coeffiecients in order to model a function, it simply creates a big tree of decisions to follow at prediction time. This model also supports multiclass classification and provides outputs as predictions and probabilities in two different columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/soltaniehha/Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/figs/11-01-Decision-Tree.png?raw=true\" width=\"800\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*<div style=\"text-align: right\"> From [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, et al </div>*\n",
    "\n",
    "While this model is usually a great start, it does come at a cost. It can overfit data extremely quickly. By that we mean that, unrestrained, the decision tree will create a pathway from the start based on every single training example. That means it encodes all of the information in the training set in the model. This is bad because then the model won’t generalize to new data (you will see poor test set prediction performance). However, there are a number of ways to try and rein in the model by limiting its branching structure (e.g., limiting its height) to get good predictive power."

    "### Model Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to configure and train decision trees. Here are the hyperparameters that Spark’s implementation supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`maxDepth`** (default: 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we’re training a tree, it can be helpful to specify a max depth in order to avoid overfitting to the dataset (in the extreme, every row ends up as its own leaf node). \n",
    "\n",
    "**`maxBins`** (default: 32)\n",
    "\n",
    "In decision trees, continuous features are converted into categorical features and `maxBins` determines how many bins should be created from continous features. More bins gives a higher level of granularity. The value must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than or equal to the number of categories in any categorical feature in your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`impurity`** (default: gini)\n",
    "\n",
    "To build up a “tree” you need to configure when the model should branch. Impurity represents the metric (information gain) to determine whether or not the model should split at a particular leaf node. This parameter can be set to either be “entropy” or “gini” (default), two commonly used impurity metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`minInfoGain`** (default: 0.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter determines the minimum information gain that can be used for a split. A higher value can prevent overfitting. This is largely something that needs to be determined from testing out different variations of the decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`minInstancesPerNode`** (default: 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum number of instances each child must have after split. If a split causes the left or right child to have fewer than minInstancesPerNode, the split will be discarded as invalid. Should be >= 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "These are configurations we specify in order to manipulate how we perform our training. Here is the training parameter for decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`checkpointInterval`** \n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointing is a way to save the model’s work over the course of training so that if nodes in the cluster crash for some reason, you don’t lose your work. A value of 10 means the model will get checkpointed every 10 iterations. Set this to -1 to turn off checkpointing. This parameter needs to be set together with a `checkpointDir` (a directory to checkpoint to) and with `useNodeIdCache=true`. Consult the Spark documentation for more information on checkpointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prediction Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one prediction parameter for decision trees: `thresholds`. Refer to the explanation for thresholds under “Logistic Regression”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a minimal but complete example of using a decision tree classifier:"
