An estimator is necessary when a transformation you would like to perform must be initialized with data or information about the input column (often derived by doing a pass over the input column itself). For example, if you wanted to scale the values in our column to have mean zero and unit variance, you would need to perform a pass over the entire data in order to calculate the values you would use to normalize the data to mean zero and unit variance. In effect, an estimator can be a transformer configured according to your particular input data. In simplest terms, you can either blindly apply a transformation (a “regular” transformer type) or perform a transformation based on your data (an estimator type). Figure below is a simple illustration of an estimator fitting to a particular input dataset, generating a transformer that is then applied to the input dataset to append a new column (of the transformed data).\n",

    "High-level transformers, such as the RFormula we saw in the previous lecture, allow you to concisely specify a number of transformations in one. These operate at a “high level”, and allow you to avoid doing data manipulations or transformations one by one. In general, **you should try to use the highest level transformers you can, in order to minimize the risk of error and help you focus on the business problem instead of the smaller details of implementation**. While this is not always possible, it’s a good objective.\n",

    "The **`RFormula`** is the easiest transfomer to use when you have “conventionally” formatted data. Spark borrows this transformer from the R language to make it simple to declaratively specify a set of transformations for your data. With this transformer, values can be either numerical or categorical and you do not need to extract values from strings or manipulate them in any way. The RFormula will automatically handle categorical inputs (specified as strings) by performing something called one-hot encoding. In brief, one-hot encoding converts a set of values into a set of binary columns specifying whether or not the data point has each particular value (we’ll discuss one-hot encoding in more depth later in the notebook). With the RFormula, numeric columns will be cast to Double but will not be one-hot encoded. If the label column is of type String, it will be first transformed to Double with StringIndexer.\n",

This is useful because you may want to simplify the features in your dataset or simplify their representations for interpretation later on. For example, imagine you have a column that represents a person’s weight and you would like to predict some value based on this information. In some cases, it might be simpler to create three buckets of “overweight,” “average,” and “underweight.”\n",

While not always necessary, doing so is usually a best practice. You might want to do this when your data contains a number of columns based on different scales. For instance, say we have a DataFrame with two columns: weight (in ounces) and height (in feet). If you don’t scale or normalize, the algorithm will be less sensitive to variations in height because height values in feet are much lower than weight values in ounces. That’s an example where you should scale your data.\n",

    "An example of normalization might involve transforming the data so that each point’s value is a representation of its distance from the mean of that column. Using the same example from before, we might want to know how far a given individual’s height is from the mean height. Many algorithms assume that their input data is normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might imagine, there are a multitude of algorithms we can apply to our data to scale or normalize it. Enumerating them all is unnecessary here because they are covered in many other texts and machine learning libraries. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept in detail, check out any of the books referenced in the previous lecture. Just keep in mind the fundamental goal—we want our data on the same scale so that values can easily be compared to one another in a sensible way. \n",

Since MLlib classification models make predictions using the indexed values, this conversion is useful for converting model predictions (indices) back to the original categories. We can do this with `IndexToString`. You’ll notice that we do not have to input our value to the String key; Spark’s MLlib maintains this metadata for you. You can optionally specify the outputs."

    "Indexing categorical variables is only half of the story. One-hot encoding is an extremely common data transformation performed after indexing categorical variables. This is because indexing does not always represent our categorical variables in the correct way for downstream models to process. For instance, when we index our “color” column, you will notice that some colors have a higher value (or index number) than others (in our case, blue is 1 and green is 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incorrect because it gives the mathematical appearance that the input to the machine learning algorithm seems to specify that green > blue, which makes no sense in the case of the current categories. To avoid this, we use `OneHotEncoder`, which will convert each distinct value to a Boolean flag (1 or 0) as a component in a vector. When we encode the color value, then we can see these are no longer ordered, making them easier for downstream models (e.g., a linear model) to process:"

    "\n",
    "Text is always tricky input because it often requires lots of manipulation to map to a format that a machine learning model will be able to use effectively. There are generally two kinds of texts you’ll see: free-form text and string categorical variables. We already discussed categorical variables in the previous section. At the beginning of this notebook we also saw an example of free-form text and were able to tokenize it. Text is a very interesting and broad discussion and beyond the scope of this course. For more text transformations I refer you to chapter 25 of the textbook and Spark's documentation."
