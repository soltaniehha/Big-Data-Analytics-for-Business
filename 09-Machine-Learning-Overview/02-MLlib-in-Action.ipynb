This “trained” transformer always has the word Model in the type signature. When we use this transformer, Spark automatically converts our categorical variable to Doubles so that we can input it into a (yet to be specified) machine learning model. In particular, it assigns a numerical value to each possible color category, creates additional features for the interaction variables between colors and value1/value2, and puts them all into a single vector.

    "Here are the various options for how you might go about deploying a Spark model. These are the general options you should be able to link to the process illustrated in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train your machine learning (ML) model offline and then supply it with offline data. In this context, we mean offline data to be data that is stored for analysis, and not data that you need to get an answer from quickly. Spark is well suited to this sort of deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train your model offline and then put the results into a database (usually a key-value store). This works well for something like recommendation but poorly for something like classification or regression where you cannot just look up a value for a given user but must calculate one based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train your ML algorithm offline, persist the model to disk, and then use that for serving. This is not a low-latency solution if you use Spark for the serving part, as the overhead of starting up a Spark job can be high, even if you’re not running on a cluster. Additionally this does not parallelize well, so you’ll likely have to put a load balancer in front of multiple model replicas and build out some REST API integration yourself. There are some interesting potential solutions to this problem, but no standards currently exist for this sort of model serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manually (or via some other software) convert your distributed model to one that can run much more quickly on a single machine. This works well when there is not too much manipulation of the raw data in Spark but can be hard to maintain over time. Again, there are several solutions in progress. For example, MLlib can export some models to PMML, a common model interchange format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train your ML algorithm online and use it online. This is possible when used in conjunction with Structured Streaming, but can be complex for some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are some of the options, there are many other ways of performing model deployment and management. This is an area under heavy development and many potential innovations are currently being worked on."
