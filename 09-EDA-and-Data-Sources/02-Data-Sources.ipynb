{"cells": [{"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "# Data Sources\nThis notebook formally introduces the variety of other data sources that you can use with Spark out of the box as well as the countless other sources built by the greater community. Spark has six \u201ccore\u201d data sources and hundreds of external data sources written by the community. The ability to read and write from all different kinds of data sources and for the community to create its own contributions is arguably one of Spark\u2019s greatest strengths. Following are Spark\u2019s core data sources:\n\n* CSV\n* JSON\n* Parquet\n* ORC\n* JDBC/ODBC connections\n* Plain-text files\n\nAs mentioned, Spark has numerous community-created data sources. Here\u2019s just a small sample:\n\n* BigQuery\n* Cassandra\n* HBase\n* MongoDB\n* AWS Redshift\n* XML\n* And many, many others\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to give you the ability to read and write from Spark\u2019s core data sources and know enough to understand what you should look for when integrating with third-party data sources. To achieve this, we will focus on the core concepts that you need to be able to recognize and understand.\n\n## The Structure of the Data Sources API\nBefore proceeding with how to read and write from certain formats, let\u2019s visit the overall organizational structure of the data source APIs.\n\n### Read API Structure\nThe core structure for reading data is as follows:\n\n> ```\nDataFrameReader.format(...).option(\"key\", \"value\").schema(...).load()\n```\n\nWe will use this format to read from all of our data sources. format is optional because by default Spark will use the Parquet format. option allows you to set key-value configurations to parameterize how you will read data. Lastly, schema is optional if the data source provides a schema or if you intend to use schema inference. Naturally, there are some required options for each format, which we will discuss when we look at each format.\n\n### Basics of Reading Data\nThe foundation for reading data in Spark is the DataFrameReader. We access this through the SparkSession via the read attribute:\n\n> ```python\nspark.read\n```\n\nAfter we have a DataFrame reader, we specify several values:\n\n* The format\n* The schema\n* The read mode\n* A series of options\n\nThe format, options, and schema each return a DataFrameReader that can undergo further transformations and are all optional, except for one option. Each data source has a specific set of options that determine how the data is read into Spark (we cover these options shortly). At a minimum, you must supply the DataFrameReader a path to from which to read.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the overall layout:\n\n``` python\nspark.read.format(\"csv\")\\\n  .option(\"mode\", \"FAILFAST\")\\\n  .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\\\n  .option(\"path\", \"path/to/file(s)\")\\\n  .load()\n```\n  \nAs we have seen before we can put the \"path\" option directly in the `load()` method, i.e.: `.load(\"path/to/file(s)\")`\n\n**READ MODES**\nReading data from an external source naturally entails encountering malformed data, especially when working with only semi-structured data sources. Read modes specify what will happen when Spark does come across malformed records. Table below lists the read modes:\n\n\n|Read mode | Description |\n| -- | -- |\n| permissive | Sets all fields to null when it encounters a corrupted record and places all corrupted records in a string column called \\_corrupt_record |\n| dropMalformed | Drops the row that contains malformed records |\n| failFast | Fails immediately upon encountering malformed records |\n\nThe default is *permissive*.\n\n**Example:** Let's load a sample CSV file, similar to what we have seen before:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 1, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "gs://qst843/Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business/data/\n"}], "source": "# the following line gets the bucket name attached to our cluster\nbucket = spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().get(\"fs.gs.system.bucket\")\n\n# specifying the path to our bucket where the data is located (no need to edit this path anymore)\ndata = \"gs://\" + bucket + \"/Big-Data-Analytics-for-Business/data/\"\nprint(data)"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 2, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stderr", "output_type": "stream", "text": "                                                                                \r"}], "source": "df = spark.read.format(\"csv\")\\\n  .option(\"header\", \"true\")\\\n  .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\\\n  .load(data + \"flight-data/csv/2010-summary.csv\")"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 3, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stderr", "output_type": "stream", "text": "[Stage 2:>                                                          (0 + 1) / 1]\r"}, {"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": "+-----------------+-------------------+-----+\n|DEST_COUNTRY_NAME|ORIGIN_COUNTRY_NAME|count|\n+-----------------+-------------------+-----+\n|    United States|            Romania|    1|\n|    United States|            Ireland|  264|\n+-----------------+-------------------+-----+\nonly showing top 2 rows\n\n"}, {"name": "stderr", "output_type": "stream", "text": "                                                                                \r"}], "source": "df.show(2)"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "### Write API Structure\nThe core structure for writing data is as follows:\n\n> ```\nDataFrameWriter.format(...).option(...).partitionBy(...).bucketBy(...)\\\n  .sortBy(...).save()```\n\nWe will use this format to write to all of our data sources. format is optional because by default, Spark will use the parquet format. option, again, allows us to configure how to write out our given data. *PartitionBy*, *bucketBy*, and *sortBy* work only for file-based data sources; you can use them to control the specific layout of files at the destination.\n\n### Basics of Writing Data\nThe foundation for writing data is quite similar to that of reading data. Instead of the *DataFrameReader*, we have the *DataFrameWriter*. Because we always need to write out some given data source, we access the *DataFrameWriter* on a per-DataFrame basis via the write attribute:"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "We can use the `write` attribute to write it to file:"}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 4, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"data": {"text/plain": "<pyspark.sql.readwriter.DataFrameWriter at 0x7fb72dc80a50>"}, "execution_count": 4, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "execute_result"}], "source": "df.write"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "After we have a DataFrameWriter, we specify three values: the format, a series of options, and the save mode.

We will cover the potential for options, which vary from data source to data source, shortly."}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 5, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stderr", "output_type": "stream", "text": "                                                                                \r"}], "source": "df.write.format(\"csv\")\\\n  .option(\"header\", \"True\")\\\n  .mode(\"overwrite\")\\\n  .save(\"path/to/file(s)\")"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "### SAVE MODES\nSave modes specify what will happen if Spark finds data at the specified location (assuming all else equal). The following table lists the save modes:\n\n| Save mode | Description |\n| -- | -- |\n| append | Appends the output files to the list of files that already exist at that location |\n| overwrite | Will completely overwrite any data that already exists there |\n| errorIfExists | Throws an error and fails the write if data or files already exist at the specified location |\n| ignore | If data or files exist at the location, do nothing with the current DataFrame |\n\nThe default is `errorIfExists`. This means that if Spark finds data at the location to which you\u2019re writing, it will fail the write immediately.\n\nWe\u2019ve largely covered the core concepts that you\u2019re going to need when using data sources, so now let\u2019s dive into each of Spark\u2019s native data sources.\n\n### CSV Files\nCSV stands for commma-separated values. This is a common text file format in which each line represents a single record, and commas separate each field within a record. CSV files, while seeming well structured, are actually one of the trickiest file formats you will encounter because not many assumptions can be made in production scenarios about what they contain or how they are structured. For this reason, the CSV reader has a large number of options. These options give you the ability to work around issues like certain characters needing to be escaped\u2014for example, commas inside of columns when the file is also comma-delimited or null values labeled in an unconventional way.\n\n### CSV Options\nFollowing table presents the options available in the CSV reader:\n\n\n|Read/write|Key|Potential values|Default |Description|\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n|Both|sep|Any single string character|,|The single character that is used as separator for each field and value.|\n|Both|header|true, false|false|A Boolean flag that declares whether the first line in the file(s) are the names of the columns.|\n|Read|escape|Any string character|\"\\\\\"|The character Spark should use to escape other characters in the file.|\n|Read|inferSchema|true, false|false|Specifies whether Spark should infer column types when reading the file.|\n|Read|ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace|true, false|false|Declares whether leading spaces from values being read should be skipped.|\n|Read|ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace|true, false|false|Declares whether trailing spaces from values being read should be skipped.|\n|Both|nullValue|Any string character|\u201c\u201d|Declares what character represents a null value in the file.|\n|Both|nanValue|Any string character|NaN|Declares what character represents a NaN or missing character in the CSV file.|\n|Both|positiveInf|Any string or character|Inf|Declares what character(s) represent a positive infinite value.|\n|Both|negativeInf|Any string or character|-Inf|Declares what character(s) represent a negative infinite value.|\n|Both|compression or codec|None, uncompressed, bzip2, deflate, gzip, lz4, or snappy|none|Declares what compression codec Spark should use to read or write the file.|\n|Both|dateFormat|Any string or character that conforms to java\u2019s SimpleDataFormat.|yyyy-MM-dd|Declares the date format for any columns that are date type.|\n|Both|timestampFormat|Any string or character that conforms to java\u2019s SimpleDataFormat.|yyyy-MM-dd\u2019T\u2019HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ|Declares the timestamp format for any columns that are timestamp type.|\n|Read|maxColumns|Any integer|20480|Declares the maximum number of columns in the file.|\n|Read|maxCharsPerColumn|Any integer|1000000|Declares the maximum number of characters in a column.|\n|Read|escapeQuotes|true, false|true|Declares whether Spark should escape quotes that are found in lines.|\n|Read|maxMalformedLogPerPartition|Any integer|10|Sets the maximum number of malformed rows Spark will log for each partition. Malformed records beyond this number will be ignored.|\n|Write|quoteAll|true, false|false|Specifies whether all values should be enclosed in quotes, as opposed to just escaping values that have a quote character.|\n|Read|multiLine|true, false|false|This option allows you to read multiline CSV files where each logical row in the CSV file might span multiple rows in the file itself.|\n\n### Reading CSV Files\nTo read a CSV file, like any other format, we must first create a `DataFrameReader` for that specific format.

It provides columnar compression, which saves storage space and allows for reading individual columns instead of entire files. It is a file format that works exceptionally well with Apache Spark and is in fact the default file format. We recommend writing data out to Parquet for long-term storage because reading from a Parquet file will always be more efficient than JSON or CSV. Another advantage of Parquet is that it supports complex types. This means that if your column is an array (which would fail with a CSV file, for example), map, or struct, you\u2019ll still be able to read and write that file without issue.

For instance, date is particularly common for a partition because, downstream, often we want to look at only the previous week\u2019s data (instead of scanning the entire list of records). This can provide massive speedups for readers.\n\n## Managing File Size\nManaging file sizes is an important factor not so much for writing data but reading it later on. When you\u2019re writing lots of small files, there\u2019s a significant metadata overhead that you incur managing all of those files. Spark especially does not do well with small files, although many file systems (like HDFS) don\u2019t handle lots of small files well, either. You might hear this referred to as the \u201csmall file problem.\u201d The opposite is also true: you don\u2019t want files that are too large either, because it becomes inefficient to have to read entire blocks of data when you need only a few rows.\n\nSpark 2.2 introduced a new method for controlling file sizes in a more automatic way. We saw previously that the number of output files is a derivative of the number of partitions we had at write time (and the partitioning columns we selected). Now, you can take advantage of another tool in order to limit output file sizes so that you can target an optimum file size. You can use the *maxRecordsPerFile* option and specify a number of your choosing. This allows you to better control file sizes by controlling the number of records that are written to each file. For example, if you set an option for a writer as `df.write.option(\"maxRecordsPerFile\", 5000)`, Spark will ensure that files will contain at most 5,000 records."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "## SQL Databases (JDBC Connection)\n\nSQL datasources are one of the more powerful connectors because there are a variety of systems to which you can connect (as long as that system speaks SQL). For instance you can connect to a MySQL database, a PostgreSQL database, or an Oracle database. Despite the importance of these kinds of data sources the details of JDBC connections are beyond the scope of this course.
